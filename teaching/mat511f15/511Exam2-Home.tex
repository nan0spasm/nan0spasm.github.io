\section*{Instructions}

This portion of Exam 2 is due by 5pm on \textbf{Friday, December 4}.  Your total combined score on the in-class portion and take-home portion is worth 20\% of your overall grade.  

\bigskip

I expect your solutions to be \emph{well-written, neat, and organized}.  Do not turn in rough drafts.  What you turn in should be the ``polished'' version of potentially several drafts.  
 
\bigskip

Feel free to type up your final version.  The \LaTeX\ source file of this exam is also available if you are interested in typing up your solutions using \LaTeX.  I'll gladly help you do this if you'd like.

\bigskip

The simple rules for the exam are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item You may freely use any theorems that we have discussed in class, but you should make it clear where you are using a previous result and which result you are using.  For example, if a sentence in your proof follows from Theorem xyz, then you should say so. 
\item Unless you prove them, you cannot use any results that we have not yet covered.
\item You are \textbf{NOT} allowed to consult external sources when working on the exam.  This includes people outside of the class, other textbooks, and online resources.
\item You are \textbf{NOT} allowed to copy someone else's work.
\item You are \textbf{NOT} allowed to let someone else copy your work.
\item You are allowed to discuss the problems with each other and critique each other's work.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
\textbf{I will vigorously pursue anyone suspected of breaking these rules.}
\end{center}

\bigskip

You should \textbf{turn in this cover page} and all of the work that you have decided to submit. \textbf{Please write your solutions and proofs on your own paper.}

\bigskip

To convince me that you have read and understand the instructions, sign in the box below.

Good luck and have fun!

\newpage

Complete any \textbf{four} of the following problems.  Write your solutions on your own paper and please put the problems in order. (4 points each)

\begin{enumerate}

\item Prove that if $G$ is a group such that $Z(G)$ is trivial, then $Z(\Aut(G))$ also trivial.

\item Prove that for all groups $G$, $\displaystyle \bigcap_{\substack{M\leq G\\ M\text{ maximal }}} M\norm G$.

\item Suppose that $G$ is a finite group having exactly $n$ Sylow $p$-subgroups, where $n>1$. Prove that there exists a homomorphic image $H$ of $G$ in $S_n$ having exactly $n$ Sylow $p$-subgroups.

\item Prove that if $G$ is a group of order 1225, then $G$ is abelian.

\item Prove that if $G$ is a group of 280, then $G$ has a normal Sylow subgroup.

\item Prove that if $G$ is a group of order 396, then $G$ is not simple.

\end{enumerate}
